RedPill
=============

A simple one-liner to get a new OS X system up and running with my basic apps. Please note that this is the result of a couple hours of hacking in a coffee shop and in no way represents anything except v1 of an idea I had in the shower. You've been warned. :)

Usage
-------

`ruby < <(curl http://github.com/dacort/redpill/redpill.rb)`

ToDo
-------

* Config files for each app
* Auto-scraping of remote websites to determine latest version
* In general, more configurability
